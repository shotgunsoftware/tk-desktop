    <p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999</p>

    <p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
        USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
        not allowed.</p>

    <p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public
        License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take
        away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
        your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>

    <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
        packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can
        use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
        License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>

    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
        designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the
        software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>

    <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask
        you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
        distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>

    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
        all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you
        link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can
        relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them
        these terms so they know their rights.</p>

    <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license,
        which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

    <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also,
        if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not
        the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
        introduced by others.</p>

    <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that
        a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a
        patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>

    <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license,
        the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
        ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
        libraries into non-free programs.</p>

    <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two
        is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
        therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>

    <p>We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's
        freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an
        advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
        Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
        circumstances.</p>

    <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
        library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
        library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In
        this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser
        General Public License.</p>

    <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to
        use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables
        many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
        system.</p>

    <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user
        of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
        modified version of the Library.</p>

    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the
        difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to
        run.</p>

    <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software
        library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
        it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
        Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>

    <p>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
        linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
        these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
        modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
        without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>

    <p>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a
        library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>

    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
        its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
        covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a
        tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the
        Library does.</p>

    <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any
        medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
        and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</p>

    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

    <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
        Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
        you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

    <p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
        notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work
        to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the
        modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
        facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
        to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
        and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute
        square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection
        2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the
        application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)</p>

    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
        from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
        License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the
        whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
        and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
        you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
        based on the Library.</p>

    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on
        the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
        this License.</p>

    <p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given
        copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
        to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
        version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if
        you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>

    <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public
        License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

    <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
        library.</p>

    <p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or
        executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
        corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

    <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
        equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
        code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

    <p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library
        by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in
        isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>

    <p>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a
        derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
        library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
        such executables.</p>

    <p>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the
        object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether
        this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
        library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

    <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
        small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
        regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of
        the Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the
        terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
        linked directly with the Library itself.</p>

    <p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;
        with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of
        your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

    <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and
        its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
        displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
        reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:</p>

    <p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
        whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
        work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the
        Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
        produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
        contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
        the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
        mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version
        of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
        version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
        to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
        performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
        designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify
        that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For
        an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility
        programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
        distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
        major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
        component itself accompanies the executable.</p>

    <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do
        not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
        together in an executable that you distribute.</p>

    <p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
        together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
        provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

    <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
        library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice
        with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
        find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
        sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
        their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

    <p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
        permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
        you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</p>

    <p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

    <p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
        limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
        contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
        cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or
        indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
        entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
        the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
        contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
        software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
        contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
        License.</p>

    <p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
        copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
        explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.</p>

    <p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License
        from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
        to address new problems or concerns.</p>

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License
        which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does
        not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.</p>

    <p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are
        incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
        and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

    <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

    <p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE
        THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
        TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
        COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

    <p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
        PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
        ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
        BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you
        want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
        redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under
        the terms of the ordinary General Public License).</p>

    <p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of
        each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
        &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

    <p>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year name of author</p>

    <p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
        Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your
        option) any later version.</p>

    <p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
        implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
        License for more details.</p>

    <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write
        to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add
        information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright
        disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

    <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library &#96;Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs)
        written by James Random Hacker.</p>

    <p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

    <p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
        this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

    <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the
        GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

    <p>0. Additional Definitions.</p>

    <p>As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
        &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

    <p>&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a
        Combined Work as defined below.</p>

    <p>An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not
        otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
        an interface provided by the Library.</p>

    <p>A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The
        particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
        Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
        the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for
        the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

    <p>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

    <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU
        GPL.</p>

    <p>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>

    <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be
        supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>

    <p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application
        does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
        remains meaningful, or</p>

    <p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p>

    <p>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>

    <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.
        You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not
        limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and
        templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

    <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library
        and its use are covered by this License.</p>

    <p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>

    <p>4. Combined Works.</p>

    <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
        modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
        such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>

    <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library
        and its use are covered by this License.</p>

    <p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>

    <p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the
        Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
        license document.</p>

    <p>d) Do one of the following:</p>

    <p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application
        Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a
        modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
        of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</p>

    <p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a)
        uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
        properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</p>

    <p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information
        under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute
        a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
        version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
        Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the
        Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
        Source.)</p>

    <p>5. Combined Libraries.</p>

    <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together
        with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a
        combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

    <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
        library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>

    <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

    <p>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
        from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
        to address new problems or concerns.</p>

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain
        numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you
        have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
        ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
        authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>

    <p>PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2<br/>
        --------------------------------------------</p>

    <p>1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation<br/>
        ("PSF"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and<br/>
        otherwise using this software ("Python") in source or binary form and<br/>
        its associated documentation.</p>

    <p>2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby<br/>
        grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,<br/>
        analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,<br/>
        distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative version,<br/>
        provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of copyright,<br/>
        i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,<br/>
        2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Python Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are<br/>
        retained in Python alone or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.</p>

    <p>3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on<br/>
        or incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make<br/>
        the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then<br/>
        Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of<br/>
        the changes made to Python.</p>

    <p>4. PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS"<br/>
        basis. PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR<br/>
        IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND<br/>
        DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS<br/>
        FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF PYTHON WILL NOT<br/>
        INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.</p>

    <p>5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON<br/>
        FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS<br/>
        A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON,<br/>
        OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.</p>

    <p>6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material<br/>
        breach of its terms and conditions.</p>

    <p>7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any<br/>
        relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and<br/>
        Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF<br/>
        trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote<br/>
        products or services of Licensee, or any third party.</p>

    <p>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as
        indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the
        Appendix below).</p>

    <p>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the
        Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
        whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include
        works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
        Works thereof.</p>

    <p>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any
        modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor

        Contribution."</p>

    <p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been
        received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

    <p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
        reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work
        and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

    <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
        to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
        section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
        counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that
        Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

    <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
        with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
        conditions:</p>

    <p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>
        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br/>
        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
        to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br/>
        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
        distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
        within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
        purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
        that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
        attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>

    <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
        Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
        conditions stated in this License.<br/>
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
        for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    </p>

    <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
        product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
        the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

    <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work
        (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
        KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

    <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
        special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
        use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
        computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
        choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
