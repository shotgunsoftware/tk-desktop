    Wrapper around a logger object. It augments the logged information when
    TK_DESKTOP_RPC_DEBUG is turned on. It also prevents logging from every single
    RPC call, which would slow down the logging process. In fact, logging
    from the Shotgun Desktop with this environment variable sends the subprocess
    into an infinite loop as logging anything from the background process
    means doing an RPC call. If from the RPC module we log messages as well,
    we end up in an infinite logging loop an the project never finishes loading.
    As such, TK_DESKTOP_RPC_DEBUG should only be used when running tests.

    One could argue why we need this, when a simple logger formatter would do
    to print the thread id and current time.
    The problem is that the logger formatter option prints the real thread id,
    which is hard to read because it is a 64bit value. When looking at test logs,
    this makes it hard to differentiate between tests. Doing in this way makes
    it a lot easier. Threads could also be named, but then in a test suite
    you wouldn't be able to differentiate between a message coming from a test
    or leaking from another test, which has been an issue in the past.
