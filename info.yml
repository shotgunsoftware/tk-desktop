        description: "Controls what apps will run on startup.  This is a list
                     where each element is a dictionary with two keys:
                     'app_instance' and 'name'.
                     The 'app_instance' value connects this entry to a
                     particular app instance defined in the environment
                     configuration file.
                     The 'name' is the menu name of the command to run when
                     desktop starts up. If 'name' is '', then all commands from
                     the given app instance are started.

                     To add the 'Apps' tab (which contains the app launcher),
                     add the following startup command to the list:
                       {app_instance: '', name: 'Apps'}

                     in which groups.  Each dictionary entry needs to have the
                     following keys: name - the name of the group, matches - a
                     list of strings for what commands to add to the group.

                     As commands are added to the engine, each match from the
                     group's matches list will be treated as a case insensitive
                     glob style match against the command's display name.  If
                     there is a match then the command will be added to the
                     group.  For example '*Maya*' will match against any command
                     that contains the string 'maya' in the display name,
                     regardless of case.

                     It is possible for a command to show up in multiple groups
                     if it has matches against multiple groups."

    collapse_rules:
        type: list
        description: "A list of dictionaries that define how to collapse multile
                     commands into a single button in the GUI. Each dictionary
                     needs to have the following keys: match - a string that will
                     match against the display name of a registered command,
                     button_label - what the text label of the resulting button
                     should be, menu_label - what the text label of the item in
                     the button's menu should be.

                     As commands are added to the engine, their display name will
                     be compared to each match in turn. The match string can
                     contain '$' style variables, which will be matched against
                     any single word in the dislay name of the command. Those
                     '$' variables are available for use in the button_label and
                     the menu_label.

                     For example a match of 'Launch $APP $VERSION' will match
                     any display name made up of 'Launch' followed by two words.
                     If the display name is 'Launch Maya 2014' then this would
                     match, and the value of '$APP' would be 'Maya' and the value
                     of '$VERSION' would be '2014'.

                     If menu_label is the special string 'None' then the button
                     name will be translated per the value of button_label, but
                     no menu entry will be added for the commands.  If multiple
                     commands collapse down to a button in this way, only the
                     first one will be registered.

                     If a display name does not match any collapse rule, then it
                     will show up as a button without any menu. The first matching
                     rule will determine the button and menu labels."
