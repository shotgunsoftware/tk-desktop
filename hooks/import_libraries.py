class ImportLibraries:
    """
    Hook for importing necessary libraries before PySide6 or other dependencies are loaded.

    This hook is executed dynamically during the bootstrap process. To use a custom
    implementation of this hook, set the environment variable `SGTK_HOOK_IMPORT_LIBRARIES`
    to the path of your custom hook file. If the variable is not set, this default
    implementation will be used.

    Purpose:
        - Import libraries that need to be loaded early to avoid conflicts caused by
          Qt initialization issues or version mismatches.
        - Ensure a stable environment for the application.

    Usage:
        - Add the required imports inside the `execute` method.
        - If using a custom hook, ensure the environment variable `SGTK_HOOK_IMPORT_LIBRARIES`
          points to the correct file path.

    Example:
        # Import libraries that need to be loaded early
        import opentimelineio
        import some_other_library

    Note:
        This hook is critical for avoiding hard-to-debug errors caused by improper
        library initialization.
