    Ran after this desktop version is installed. It is run to make sure that
    the Shotgun API version is the one bundled with core v0.16.0 or higher.
    This test is required because the Desktop app historically didn't restart
    the Desktop app after updating core. Because of this, upgrading to core
    v0.16.0 meant that the wrong version of shotgun_api3 would be in memory.
    Therefore, even though the code was updated and the newer engine downloaded,
    we were actually still running the old code. This causes a crash in the
    tk-desktop engine because it expects the shotgun_api3 module to have
    the AuthenticationFault class. When we're running into this situation,
    we'll simply make sure we are in Desktop and if we are, we'll import
    the splash screen, let the user know an upgrade took place and reboot the
    app.
