class PreInitialization:
    """
    Hook executed before the main initialization process.

    This hook is executed dynamically during the bootstrap process. To use a custom
    implementation of this hook, specify the path to your custom hook file in
    the tk-desktop.yml file of your custom config. If a custom path is not specified, this
    default implementation will be used.

    Purpose:
        - Perform tasks that need to be executed early in the bootstrap process.
        - Ensure a stable environment for the application.

    Usage:
        - Add the required logic inside the `execute` method.
        - If using a custom hook, ensure the path of your custom hook file is set in the tk-desktop.yml
          of your custom config.

    Example:
        # Perform early initialization tasks
        import opentimelineio
        import some_other_library

    Note:
        This hook is critical for setting up the environment and avoiding hard-to-debug errors.
